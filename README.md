Just playing around with CS:GO hacking.

## What it can currently do?

- Only blocking flashbangs.

## How to run?

1. Create virtualenv & activate it:

    ```
    virtualenv2 .env
    . .env/bin/activate
    ```

2. Install requirements:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run it (should work without root):

    ```
    ./app.py
    # Try with sudo if it crashes
    sudo ./app.py
    ```
